# Recipes

## This is an open source collection of recipes used during my time at lighthouse labs. If you have any requests please submit a pull and feel free to add whatever you'd wish with a few restrictions

1. Must be tested before submission. Don't simply post an online recipe without firsthand testing.
2. Be accurate. As best possible make everything simple to follow for novice cooks. Approximate timeing and ingreadients is fine to a degree.
3. Try to include

- Prep time
- cook time
- yield

4. as best possible bring leftovers to share. Sharing is caring.
