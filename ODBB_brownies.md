# ODBB - The ol' dirty bastard brownies

## Ingredients

### brownies

- 1 and 1/4 sticks (140g) unsalted butter
- 1 and 1/2 cups (300g) granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup (75g) cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs, cold
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup (60g) plain/all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup (90g) chocolate chips
- 16 Oreos, whole
- Oreos, chopped

### peanut butter sauce

- 1/4 tsp water
- 3 tbsp peanut butter
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar

1. Preheat over to 180C/350F. Line 8x8" square baking pan with parchment paper (or tin foil), leaving the paper enough space to slightly overhang from two sides. This will make the brownies easier to remove from the pan.
2. cube the butter and place with granulated sugar, cocoa powder, and salt into a microwave safe bowl. Heat for 30 second and stir well. Continue the process of microwaving and stirring until you have a well combined batter that is hot to the touch (50-70C)
3. in a seperate small bowl mix eggs & vanilla, then mix well into the hot batter. Fold in the flour and gently fold in the chocolate chips. Don't let them all melt.
4. Pour half the batter into the baking tray, then arrange the 16 whole oreos flat across the batter. Add the rest of the batter, press flat, then top with the chopped oreos.
5. bake 30-35 minutes (or longer depending on the oven). Check for doneness by inserting a clean toothpick into the middle of the brownie. It should come out almost clean with a few moist crumbs.
6. let cool on wire rack completely before removing from the tray to cut.
7. In a small microwaveable bowl, add the peanut butter and water for 30 seconds. mix in the powdered sugar gradually until you have a warm, runny peanut sauce. Top the brownies and let cool completely.

## NOTES

- You can change this up easily by using reeses chips instead of chocolate
- Use mint chocolate chips and make a mint chocolate sauce instead of peanut butter
- Can try using peanut butter oreos as well
